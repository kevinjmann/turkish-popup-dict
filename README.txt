A Turkish popup dictionary with an autosummarization feature. On pages in the .tr domain, double click on a word, and a popup containing the possible lemmas, morphological analyses and definitions is displayed. Select a block of text and right click to select "make a summary from this text" to display a popup containing a summary 1/4th the size of the original text.

This plugin is generalizable as long as there is an FST file in the .att format and a bilingual dictionary.
